//! # Multisig pallet
//! A pallet for doing multisig dispatch.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This pallet contains functionality for multi-signature dispatch, a (potentially) stateful
//! operation, allowing multiple signed
//! origins (accounts) to coordinate and dispatch a call from a well-known origin, derivable
//! deterministically from the set of account IDs and the threshold number of accounts from the
//! set that must approve it. In the case that the threshold is just one then this is a stateless
//! operation. This is useful for multisig wallets where cryptographic threshold signatures are
//! not available or desired.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! * `as_multi` - Approve and if possible dispatch a call from a composite origin formed from a
//!   number of signed origins.
//! * `approve_as_multi` - Approve a call from a composite origin.
//! * `cancel_as_multi` - Cancel a call from a composite origin.

// Ensure we're `no_std` when compiling for Wasm.
